    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberRestricted`
    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberLeft`

    considered equal, if their :attr:`user` and :attr:`status` are equal.

          Therefore, most of the arguments and attributes were removed and you should no longer
          use :class:`ChatMember` directly.
